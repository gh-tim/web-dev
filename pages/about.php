					At the Food Aid Foundation, we are a compassionate non-profit, non-governmental organization dedicated to bridging the gap between 
					surplus food and those in need. Our mission is to ensure that no one goes to bed hungry, by connecting food banks and local 
					communities, fostering a sense of togetherness, and addressing food insecurity in a sustainable and dignified manner. 
				</div>

				<div class="about-main" id="section-2">Our Vision</div>
				<div class="about-sec">
					We envision a society where every individual, regardless of their circumstances, has reliable access to nourishing food. We see 
					communities coming together to support one another, fostering a sense of empathy, kindness, and solidarity. Through our efforts, 
					we aim to build a future where food waste is minimized, resources are optimized, and the dignity of every person is upheld.
				</div>

				<div class="about-main" id="section-3">Our Objectives</div>
				<div class="about-sec">
					To achieve our vision, we have come up with a set of objectives. Little by little, these objectives contribute to a bigger picture.
					<br><br>
					<ol>
						<li>Redistribute Surplus Food: Our primary objective is to create a seamless process for businesses, farmers, and individuals 
						to donate excess food, which is then efficiently distributed to food banks and community organizations.
						</li><br>

						<li>Combat Food Insecurity: We are committed to actively addressing food insecurity by ensuring that the food we redistribute 
						reaches those who need it the most, including vulnerable populations, children, seniors, and low-income families.
						</li><br>

						<li>Raise Awareness: By raising awareness about food waste and its impact on communities, we aim to educate and engage 
						individuals, businesses, and policymakers in the fight against hunger.
						</li><br>

						<li>Promote Sustainability: The Food Aid Foundation is dedicated to promoting sustainable practices by reducing food waste and its environmental 
						footprint, contributing to a healthier planet for current and future generations.
						</li><br>
					</ol>
